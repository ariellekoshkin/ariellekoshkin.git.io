Hi! My name is Arielle Koshkin and I am a current master student in the <a href="https://www.computationalmountainstudies.com/">  Computational Mountain Studies Research Group</a>, in the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/hydrologic-sciences">Graduate Program of Hydrological Sciences</a> at University of Nevada, Reno. My research explores how large fires impact the melt rates and storage of snow and in turn have downstream effects on water resources and water mangers. I received a B.A. in Biology from Carleton College in Northfield, MN. In my free time, I love to explore the mountains by bike, foot, or ski.

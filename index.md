# Arielle Koshkin
## MS Student, Hydrologic Sciences <br /> University of Nevada, Reno


[Wooo science! I research stuff. Snow is cool -- description here]

Arielle Koshkin grew up in Oakland, CA, and received a B.S. in Biology from Carleton College in Northfield, MN. Prior to graduate school, Arielle taught high school science, worked at a local land trust, and lead trips abroad for high school students. She is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in the Graduate Program of Hydrological Science. Her research is focused on understanding the post-fire impacts on alpine snowpack in snow-dominated watersheds and the subsequent hydrological impacts these massive fires have on water resources. In her free time, she loves to explore the mountains by bike, foot, or ski.
